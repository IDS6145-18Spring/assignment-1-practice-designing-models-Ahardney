## Smart City (My Problem) Model

Smart Corridors
# This will be the code for the Smart Corridors

def_init_(self, atm, ttm, seir):
	#Initializes Smart Corridors
self.active traffic management = atm
self.travel time monitoring = ttm
self.sensors embedded in roads = seir
self.height = 6.0
self.width = 6.0
Interface._init_(self, atm, ttm, seir)

Freight Corridors
#This will code for Freight Corridors
def_init_(self, acfv, sp, tt):
	#Initialize Freight Corridors
self.automated and connected freight vehicles = acfv
self.signals that prioritize truck movement in evening = sp
self.traffic or transportation data analytics platform = tt
self.height = 6.0
self.width = 6.0
