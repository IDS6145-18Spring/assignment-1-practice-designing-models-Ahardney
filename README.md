## General Introduction

A **smart city** relies on technology to improve life in urban area. Technology has seep deeper into the fabric of everyday life, and governments are looking at how to incorporate technology into our everyday lives.

(remove: States your motivation clearly: why is it important / interesting to solve this problem?)
(remove: Add real-world examples, if any)
(remove: Put the problem into a historical context, from what does it originate? Are there already some proposed solutions?)

## Requirements (Experimental Design)

(remove: You should start by specifying a set of requirements. I specified a topic Smart Cities but what exactly does that mean-  you should practice formulating your own set of requirements and an experiment. Define a hypothesis of a problem cities face and how a smart city would possibly help alleviate this issue. This helps you think about your problem communication and system objectives inputs, functions, and outputs - they should be clearly specified.)

## Smart City (My Problem) Model

(remove: add a high-level overview of your model, the part below should link to the model directory markdown files)
(remove: Look at the [**Object Diagram**](model/object_diagram.md) for how to structure this part of Part 2 for each diagram. Only the Object diagram has the template, the rest are blank. )

## Smart City (My Problem) Simulation

(remove: for part 3 add two to three sentences here and link the [**(your own name)**](model/README.md) file in the analysis folder - which describe how you would simulate this - type of simulation, rough details -inputs, outputs - how it will help you analyze your experimental hypothesis, or nullify your null hypothesis.)


## Smart City (My Problem) Model
[**Code template**](code/README.md) - Starting coding framework for the (insert your exact problem here.)

## **P**ortable **O**rganic **T**rouble-free **S**elf-watering System (**POTS**) Model
Here [**we provide an overview**](code/POTS_system/README.md) of the **P**ortable **O**rganic **T**rouble-free **S**elf-watering System (**POTS**) Model and provide a source code template.
